## Location of Config files

The config file, which is in TOML format, (which, if things work well, you shouldn't need to edit) location
is platform-dependent and is thus:

- Windows: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Mackenzie Serres\meshchat\config\config.toml`
- Linux: `~/.config/meshchat/config.toml`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/net.Mackenzie-Serres.meshchat/config.toml`
