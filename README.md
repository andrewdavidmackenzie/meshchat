# MeshChat
An Iced cross-platform GUI application to interact with Meshtastic LoRa radios:
- find Bluetooth Low Energy attached meshtastic devices
- connect to one
- use it to chat with others using the available channels

## Thinking
My current thinking is to keep it as simple to look at and use as possible, not being extremely geeky LoRa/Mesh
app and try to give users a simple chat experience, similar to ones they will be accustomed to with WhatsApp, Telegram
etc.

That will probably mean that for a while at least, they will need to use some other app to configure their radio
and join a mesh.
